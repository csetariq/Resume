#Small-scale Software undertakings

Implemented Community-Based Preference-Aware Location Recommendation System. When a user performs check-in a location, It recommends him/her locations that he/she would potentially likes to visit. Recommendations are based on interests of them or people with similar interest.

Implemented Decision Tree-based Missing Value Imputation (DMI) Algorithm. It imputes missing values in a data set using Decision tree to make it complete; such complete data set would then be used for Data Mining.

Developed Quiz Master, an interactive application to conduct quiz-alike competition to a number of candidates at a time. It includes randomization of question sample to avoid delivery of questions in the same order for each candidate. It also features necessary settings such as time limit, number of questions etc.
